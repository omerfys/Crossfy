"""Unlock a locked Windows console so injected input has somewhere to land.

Beamer cannot type on the lock screen and never will: that is the Winlogon
secure desktop, whose security descriptor admits only SYSTEM, and SendInput
only reaches the desktop its calling thread is attached to. Running elevated
clears UIPI, not desktop access -- which is why an admin Beamer still cannot
touch a locked machine.

So this module does not inject into the lock screen. It asks an external
unlock credential provider to take the machine *off* the lock screen, after
which the console is back on the Default desktop and the ordinary
input_injector.py path works unchanged. That provider is optional and not
part of this repository.

The provider is a COM DLL that LogonUI loads as SYSTEM. It waits on an
auto-reset event and, when signalled, submits the password stored in a
machine-DPAPI blob. Its event's DACL grants Authenticated Users
EVENT_MODIFY_STATE, so an unelevated Beamer can signal it and no Beamer
process ever holds a password.

The provider owns the unlock; Beamer only knocks. Shipping a second
provider would put two waiters on one auto-reset event, which is a real way
to lose the signal. If the provider is not installed, every call here fails
cleanly and Beamer behaves as it did before.

Guarded like clipboard_win.py and input_injector.py so it stays importable,
and its orchestration testable, on a machine without ctypes.windll.
